            The [Kenisha] iDisciple №XXI MIRROR EFFECT THEORY: Exposing A-YOU within YOU™ originated from the ageless
            principles and wisdom teachings rooted within [Kenisha] iDisciple №XXI’s Gospels for Generations - Gospel of
            ALL THAT IS, Gospel of FEAR and Gospel of LOVE - and blossomed through her experiences with divine-intuition
            (7th-Sense) that, when followed, ripples peace-in-rhythm. Within [Kenisha] iDisciple №XXI MIRROR EFFECT
            THEORY: Exposing A-YOU within YOU™:
          </div>
          <br><br>

          A-YOU is the Gospel of LOVE (internal-self) within, graciously serving your best interests unconditionally.
          YOU
          is the Gospel of FEAR(external-self) seeking unsatisfying approval and concerned with appearance to the
          outside
          world.
          <br><br>

          When A-YOU faces YOU in a MIRROR EFFECT, something remarkable begins. YOU of FEAR gradually expel to A-YOU of
          LOVE. Feeling exposed yet empowered, an undeniable self-love appears and consistently shows up in the Gospel
          of<br>
          <center>ALL THAT IS (the “Universe”)</center>
          <br><br>

          Influenced by [Kenisha] iDisciple №XXI MIRROR EFFECT THEORY: Exposing A-YOU within YOU™, our Affairs and
          products were intentionally designed to be in service of “pleasing the soul”, NOW and FOREVER™.  The Affairs
