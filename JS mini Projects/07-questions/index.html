            <p>Linked lists can be considered both linear and non-linear data structures. This depends upon the 
              application that they are used for.
              <span>When linked list is used for access strategies, it is considered as a linear data-structure. When they are 
                used for data storage, it can be considered as a non-linear data structure.</span>

                Insertion and Deletion:
                Insertion and deletion process is expensive in an array as the room has to be created for the new 
                elements and existing elements must be shifted.
                But in a linked list, the same operation is an easier process, as we only update the address present in the 
                next pointer of a node.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dynamic Data Structure:
                Linked list is a dynamic data structure that means there is no need to give an initial size at the time of 
                creation as it can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory.
                Whereas, the size of an array is limited as the number of items is statically stored in the main memory.
                No wastage of memory
              </p>
              <p>
                As the size of a linked list can grow or shrink based on the needs of the program, there is no memory 
                wasted because it is allocated in runtime.
                In arrays, if we declare an array of size 10 and store only 3 elements in it, then the space for 3 elements 
                is wasted. Hence, chances of memory wastage is more in arrays

            <p>Following are the scenarios where we use linked list over array:<br>
              When we do not know the exact number of elements beforehand.<br>
              When we know that there would be large number of add or remove operations.<br>
              Less number of random access operations.<br>
              When we want to insert items anywhere in the middle of the list, such as when implementing a priority <br>
              queue, linked list is more suitable.<br>
              Below are the cases where we use arrays over the linked list:<br>
              When we need to index or randomly access elements more frequently.<br>
              When we know the number of elements in the array beforehand in order to allocate the right amount of 
              memory.<br>
              When we need speed while iterating over the elements in the sequence.<br><br>
              When memory is a concern:<br>
              Due to the nature of arrays and linked list, it is safe to say that filled arrays use less memory than linked 
              lists.<br>
              Each element in the array indicates just the data whereas each linked list node represents the data as <br>
              well as one or more pointers or references to the other elements in the linked list.<br>
              To summarize, requirements of space, time, and ease of implementation are considered while deciding 
              which data structure has to be used over what.

            <p>This is a complex type of a linked list wherein a node has two references:<br>
              One that connects to the next node in the sequence
              Another that connects to the previous node.<br>
              This structure allows traversal of the data elements in both directions (left to right and vice versa).<br><br>
              Applications of DLL are:<br>
              A music playlist with next song and previous song navigation options.<br>
              The browser cache with BACK-FORWARD visited pages<br>
              The undo and redo functionality on platforms such as word, paint etc, where you can reverse the node 
              to get to the previous page.
