                                 Kenisha Paranso’s sole purpose is “pleasing the soul”, NOW and FOREVER™. Since her
                                existence, she witnessed liberty expressed through: (1) family spirituality: Queen Heleen’s
                                divine essence and worship, King Everald’s paramount commitment to counsel and their
                                outspoken enlightening truth – “serve God”; and (2) family traditional tailoring: Lesma’s
                                breathless garment creations, PrettyElithe’s devotion to fashion extravaganza and Queen
                                Heleen’s love affair with style and confidence.

                                Kenisha Paranso is magnetically drawn to philosophy and the extraordinary.  She reveres
                                iconic aesthetic expressions - a tribute to Alexander McQueen and his masterpiece
                                collections - “masculinity and femininity desire me, stilettos highlight me, runways melt me
                                and avant-garde silences me”.  She galvanizes the gutsy spirit of Franca Sozzani and her
                                pioneering All Black Vogue edition.  She treasures human genetic flaws and Pat McGrath’s
                                cosmetic genius LAB.  She is empowered by serenity and Iyanla Vanzant’s spirituality.  She
                                strives to walk the footprints of Angelina Jolie’s mark on humanity.  She appreciates
                                intelligence and is unapologetically mesmerized by Michelle & Barak Obama’s revolutionary
                                journey. She exposes her spirituality and indulges her fashion appetite despite being
                                compelled to a legal and social education delight.

                                feeds her romantic exhibition, the GIFT of her “KingBlue” crowns her a force of nature,
                                Jamaica is the paradise “dat mek har feel irie” and Sex and the City interrelates her with
